**3DUI IEEE VR Competition**

A Virtual Symphony to train music artists.

Playtesting
During playtesting, we mostly focused on fixing bugs in the project. In addition to bugfixes, we made the instructions more clear for the user, added a snap back return when the instruments are released, changed the mixers in ensemble mode for each instrument to have its own mixer, and fixed some issues with the songs.
